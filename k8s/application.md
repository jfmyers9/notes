# Application

## Why do you think you (or your nominee) are a good fit for this role?

I believe that I would be a good fit for this role for the following reasons:

* Over the past five and half years at Pivotal I have worked extensively in the
  Cloud Foundry ecosystem. This includes experience with the original CF Runtime
  for 1 year, Diego for 2 years with 1 year as anchor, CFCR for 3 months in
  Dublin, and am currently on the BOSH team as the anchor for over a year. My
  experiences on these various teams have given me a broad set of knowledge
  relating to container scheduling and infrastructure provisioning. I hope that
  I can apply this knowledge and learnings to the Kubernetes space, but also
  learn from the Kubernetes space and continue to communicate with other Pivotal
  teams to keep our products progressing forward.
* I have a strong passion for open source projects. For the large majority of my
  professional career I have worked on open source projects. I think this has
  refined my ability to communicate with the open source community to handle
  issues and collaborate on future directions. Some examples of this in the past
  have been working with IBM to achieve scale targets for Diego, or the more
  recently working on BOSH's open source communication techniques to greatly
  reduce the number of open issues and pull requests while also increasing the
  response time on new issues.
* I have definite plans to move to New York at some point early next year
  (around April). One thing that was called out in the application request was
  that Pivotal would like an engineer that has the ability to overlap with both
  the west coast, but also the ability to stay connected with engineers in
  Europe. My plans to move to New York would align well with these goals as I
  would be able to continue my relationships with west coast engineers but be in
  a flexible time zone for communicating with Europe and the rest of the United
  States time zones.
* I am self driven and believe that I would thrive in the flexibility provided
  by the role. As my time at Pivotal has gone on, I have continually searched
  for more independence and flexibility with how I work and solve problems.
  Whether this has been exploring ETCD and how to properly right a BOSH release
  to operate it while working on CFCR, or embracing the balanced team on BOSH to
  explore and drive through features and improvements to the product, I think
  that I have shown an ability to self organize and direct myself at solving
  worthwhile problems.

## Why do you think this role would be great for you (or for your nominee)?

I believe this role would be a great fit for me for the following reasons:

* I am very interested in the domain associated with Kubernetes. Container
  scheduling, systems programming, infrastructure provisioning, and related
  topics have been an interest for me since I first joined Pivotal. Being able
  to work on these topics in an entirely new context would be revitalizing and
  enjoyable. I feel like I have been embedded in the Cloud Foundry ecosystem for
  so long, that solving new problems in these areas for is a very exciting
  opportunity. From a career development perspective, being able to become more
  associated with Kubernetes would be invaluable to my growth and would help me
  grow as an engineer associated with Cloud Foundry.
* I strongly desire the flexibility and self determination that are associated
  with the role. I feel like I am searching for a role in which I can dictate
  how and what I work to a greater extent. Also taking a break from 100% pairing
  seems desirable and rewarding.
* I am eager to continue working in open source software. This role gives me the
  opportunity to participate and engage with one of the most active and
  respected open source communities. This is something that would be very
  engaging and satisfying to me.
* I think this role would allow me the ability to move offices at the beginning
  of next year, which is definitely something that I am looking forward to
  doing.
