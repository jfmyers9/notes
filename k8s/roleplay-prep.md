# Roleplay Prepartion

* [jfmyers] Difficulty finding ways to productively contribute to "help wanted"
  issues
  * I am finding many of these issues to lack contextual information and
    concrete guidance on acceptable solutions
  * Would it be valuable to standardize the "help wanted" issue format to
    facilitate outside contribution?
* [jfmyers] Container image stamping areas for contribution
