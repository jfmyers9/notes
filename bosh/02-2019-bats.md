# Bosh Release Acceptance Tests

## `auditd_spec.rb`

* Runs `ps ax -o ucmd` on a batlight instance and checks that the following
  daemons are running:
  * `crond`
  * `kauditd`
  * `auditd`
  * `rsyslogd`

## `backup_and_restore_deployment_spec.rb`

**DEPRECATED**

* Runs the backup and restore process using old `bosh` cli functionality.
* These endpoints have since been removed from BOSH and therefore this test
  should be removed.

## `network_configuration_spec.rb`

* This test uses a static IP address and a vip network
* Tests that DNS entries of the format
  `<index>.<instance-group>.<network>.<deployment>.bosh` resolve to the correct
  IP address from outside of the instance
* Tests that reverse DNS lookups return the correct hostname for the instance
* Tests that instance hostnames can be resolved using `dig` from the deployed
  instance
* Tests that a new DNS server can be configured and is successfully added to
  `/etc/resolve.conf`
* Tests that when using manual networking, a user can change the static IP
  address of an instance
  * Detects the presence of the second static IP address through `ifconfig` on
    the instance
* Tests that when using manual networking, multiple manual networks can be
  specified for the instance
  * Detects the precense of both static IP addresses through `ifconfig` on the
    instance

## `persistent_disks_spec.rb`

**PENDING**

These tests are pending as they do not currently work on vSphere.

* Tests that multiple persistent disks can be attached to an instance
  * Detects the presence of both disks by using `lsblk`
* Tests that after deploying with multiple persistent disks, the following is
  possible:
  * Deploy with only a single disk
  * Detect that the second disk is "orphaned"
  * `bosh attach-disk <instance> <orphaned-disk-cid>` succeeds
  * Detects the previously orphaned disk size using `lsblk`

## `raw_ephemeral_disk_spec.rb`

* Tests that when using `raw_instance_storage: true` the instance has all
  available ephemeral disks and is properly labeled:
  * `ls /dev/disk/by-partlabel | grep raw-ephemeral-0`

## `service_configuration_spec.rb`

* Runit tests:
  * Tests that `runit` will delete `/etc/service/monit` before the agent starts
  * Tests that `runit` will restart `monit` if it is killed before the `agent`
    starts successfully
  * Tests that `runit` will restart the BOSH `agent` if it is killed before the
    `agent` starts successfully
  * Tests that `runit` does not delete `/etc/service/monit` if it is restarted
    after the `agent` has started successfully
  * Tests that `runit` will restart `monit` if it is killed after the `agent`
    starts successfully
  * Tests that `runit` will restart the BOSH `agent` if it is killed after the
    `agent` starts successfully
* Agent tests:
  * Tests that the agent starts `monit`
  * Tests that the agent mounts a `tmpfs` at `/var/vcap/data/sys/run`
  * Tests that the agent symlinks `/etc/sv/monit` -> `/etc/service/monit`
  * Tests that the agent removes pre-existing pidfiles from
    `/var/vcap/data/sys/run` after reboot
  * Tests that when the agent is only restarted by `runit` it does not do the
    following:
    * Remount `/var/vcap/data/sys/run`
    * Remove existing pidfiles
    * Resymlink `/etc/sv/monit` -> `/etc/service/monit`
    * Restart `monit`
* Monit tests:
  * Tests that `monit` restarts a monitored process
  * Tests that `monit` restarts a monitored process after being restarted by
    `runit`

## `with_release_stemcell_deployment_spec.rb`

* Tests that `sudo pkill -9 agent` does not cause an instance to be `failing`
* Tests that `bosh ssh <instance> -c "uname -a"` works and returns `Linux`
* Tests that `bosh stop` and `bosh start` succeed
* Tests that `bosh logs --agent` retrieves agent logs
* Tests that `bosh logs` retrieves job logs

## `with_release_stemcell_failed_deployment_spec.rb`

* Tests that the deployment process stops if the canary instance fails for a new
  deployment
* Tests that the deployment process stops if the canary instance fails for an
  existing deployment

## `with_release_stemcell_spec.rb`

* Tests that the appropriate partitions are made on the root disk if there is no
  ephemeral disk
* Tests that data is migrated between persistent disks when updating persistent
  disk size
* Tests that `bosh ssh -c sudo whoami` returns `root`
* Tests that no-op deploys do not update instances
* Tests that jobs can be co-located on the same instance
  * `ps aux | grep <job>` returns true for all jobs on the same instance
* Tests that `bosh ssh -c hostname` works when using static IPs and manual
  networking
* Tests that `bosh ssh -c hostname` works when using VIP networks
